The O

Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq B-MISC
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O

The O
rules O
will O
also O
require O
that O

be O
displayed O
with O
prices O
better O
than O
those O
available O
in O

publicly O
available O

In O
a O

, O

specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O

, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O

order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O

. O

The O
SEC B-ORG
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O

" O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O

, O
the O
SEC B-ORG
noted O
that O

that O

It O
noted O
that O

lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O

. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

The O
SEC B-ORG
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O

trade O

there O
were O

that O
meant O

not O
going O
off O
