" O
I O
still O
feel O
it O

embarrassing O
what O
happened O

I O
was O
about O
to O
pull O
out O
yesterday O
and O
say O
, O
' O
That O
's O
it O
, O
' O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
, O
one O
of O
a O
host O
of O
men O
who O
cried O
foul O
over O
seeding O
procedures O
that O
forced O
an O
unprecedented O
remaking O
of O
the O
men O
's O
draw O
last O
week O
. O

Kafelnikov B-PER
had O
pulled O
out O
of O
last O
week O
's O
tournament O
with O
a O
rib O
injury O
. O

Stich B-PER
said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B-ORG
. O

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
. O
" O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O
start O
the O
tournament O
tomorrow O
. O
" O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich B-PER
got O
on O
the O
court O
, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
year O
's O
last O
Grand B-MISC
Slam I-MISC
. O

He O
took O
a O
positive O
first O
step O
with O
his O
6-3 O
1-6 O
6-1 O
7-5 O
win O
over O
compatriot O
Haas B-PER
on O
a O
sun-baked O
Grandstand B-MISC
court O
. O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich B-PER
's O
mind O
that O
U.S. B-MISC
Open I-MISC
officials O
did O
tamper O
with O
the O
seeding O
process O
in O
order O
to O
benefit O
homegrown O
players O
. O

It O
was O
Agassi B-PER
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

The O
flamboyant O
American B-MISC
star O
was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP B-ORG
ranking O
of O
eight O
to O
a O
seeding O
of O
six O
. O

Stich B-PER
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O
seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov B-PER
withdrew O
. O

But O
Stich B-PER
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
that O
game O
. O

" O
I O
think O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
as O
everybody O
else O
who O
is O
in O
the O
top O
16 O
deserves O
to O
be O

to O
a O
market O
order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O
prices O
. O

" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
, O
" O
said O
SEC B-ORG
Chairman O
Arthur B-PER
Levitt I-PER
. O

The O
SEC B-ORG
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC B-ORG
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

The O
SEC B-ORG
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O
investors O
with O
market O
orders O
to O
trade O
at O
a O
better O
price O
if O
there O
were O
shifts O
in O
prices O
before O
their O
orders O
were O
executed O
. O

The O
agency O
said O
it O
would O
monitor O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
new O
rules O
before O
considering O
the O
" O
price O
improvement O
" O
proposal O
again O
. O

The O
agency O
also O
proposed O
rule O
changes O
that O
would O
require O
continuous O
" O
bid O
" O
and O
" O
ask O
" O
quotations O
from O
exchange O
specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
who O
trade O
more O
than O
1 O
percent O
of O
a O
stock O
during O
any O
quarter O
on O
Nasdaq B-MISC
. O

The O
SEC B-ORG

limit O

rule O
will O
mean O
a O
major O
change O
for O

Andrei B-PER
Medvedev I-PER
exchanged O
his O
reputation O
as O
the O
clown O
prince O
of O

on O

for O
a O
new O
no-nonsense O
attitude O
that O
has O
made O
life O
on O

fun O
again O

It O
was O
Medvedev B-PER

sixth O
victory O
in O
a O
row O
after O
winning O
his O
first O
tournament O
of O
the O
year O
last O
week O
at O
the O
Hamlet B-MISC
Cup I-MISC

" O
I O
realised O
this O
year O
, O
that O
without O
putting O
99.9 O
percent O
of O
your O
mind O
into O
tennis O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
successful O
, O
" O
said O
the O
22-year-old O
Medvedev B-PER
. O

" O
The O
whole O
day O
I O
'm O
thinking O
abnout O
tennis O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O
things O
I O
was O
doing O
the O
years O

they O
were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O
helping O
me O
at O
all O
. O
" O

For O
Medvedev B-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O
peripheral O
issues O
such O
as O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O
food O
in O
the O

an O
entertaining O

that O
took O
his O

off O
the O

at O
hand O
. O

" O
I O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
here O
for O

who O
lost O

the O
Open B-MISC
the O
last O
two O
years O
after O
reaching O
the O

the O

he O
tried O
his O

I O

and O
to O
win O

I O
have O
much O
more O
fun O
on O

, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Just O
three O
years O

Medvedev B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French B-MISC
Open I-MISC
semifinal O
and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

But O
Medvedev B-PER
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O

as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O
Ukrainian B-MISC
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
44th O
two O

" O
It O
's O
somewhere O
where O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev B-PER
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 O
. O
" O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O
the O
penalty O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
" O

" O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O

we O
started O
from O
zero O
, O
" O
said O
Medvedev B-PER
. O
" O

Winning O
in O
Long B-LOC
Island I-LOC
( O

was O
like O

" O

While O
Medvedev B-PER

77-minute O

past O
Fleurian B-PER
was O
rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O

I O

the O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O

when O
you O

the O

" O

We O
